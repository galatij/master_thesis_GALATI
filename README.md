# master_thesis_GALATI
Master thesis on Coulomb friction at the interface of faults.


# Modified and implemented functions:
- cpt_normal.m: returns N s.t. i can do \sigma * n as (N D Bloc), and then to get the normal stress \sigma_n i do (n' N D Bloc)
- cpt_Gloc.m and assemble_B.m: to assemble the second linear matrix
- cpt_KKTloc.m and cpt_KKT.m: to assemble the Jacobian and the residual contributions related to the KKT conditions, to be used in the Newton solver. TODO:
  - choose where to cpt sigman(u) and where to store it (if needed) for the computation of Pgamma(u);
  - modify KKT matrix (for the Jacobian) depending of maskP, applying a choice for semi-smooth Newton
- cpt_Jacobian.m: to compute the Jacobian (and the residual), to be used inside newton_solver.m. It will incorporate the linear contributions (assembled in the main) and the two non-linear terms, the first related to KKT conditions and the second related to Coulomb friction.
- cpt_stress_interf.m: to compute the stress at the interface, given the solution u at iteration k. Needed for the computation of Pgamma(u) in both the nonlinear terms.Ã¹

TODO: 
1. choose where to compute/store sigma(u) at the interface
2. complete the implementation of semi-smooth Newton for KKT conditions only
3. debug and test this easier problem
4. keep going with the friction term (it should be similar to the KKT term)
